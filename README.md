# JavaScipt QUIZ


This is a simple web page which acts as a short quiz. There are only a few questions, which are multiple choice. 


## Getting Started


Open the web page in your browser. When ready, click START and the quiz will begin. There are 120 seconds to answer to 6 questions. Each incorrect answer will reduce the timer by 10 seconds. At the end, provide your initials so the web page will use them next time, when you repeat the quiz. Data is stored locally in your browser.
